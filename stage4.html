      Oh, and speaking of relationships, how she dare
      cheat on you? You're way better off without her
      in your life. You don't need someone who would
      betray your trust like that. You deserve someone
      who appreciates you
      <br>
      I just wanna sayâ€”you're way better off without 
      Britney in your life. You don't need someone
      from the past to define you.<br>
      <br>
      You're amazing all on your own!<br>
      You deserve someone who appreciates you for<br>
      who you are now, not who you were. Keep doing<br>
      your thing, focusing on your music and career. <br>
      The right person will come along when the time<br> 
      is right, and they'll be even better for you!<br>
      <br>
      Who knows, maybe that person could even be me?<br>
      Just kidding!<br>
      <br>
      But seriously, Justin, I'll always be here<br>
      supporting you, no matter what. You've<br>
      captured my heart with your talent and charisma,<br>
      and I can't help but dream about the amazing<br>
      person you are. Keep following your dreams, and<br>
      who knows what the future holds?<br>
      <br>
      Justin, I'm your number one fan, and I can't<br>
      wait to see what you do next! Keep shining,<br>
      keep being you, and know that there are fans<br>
      like me cheering you on every step of the way!<br>
      <br>
      Lots of love.<br>
